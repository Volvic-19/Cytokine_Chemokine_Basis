## 1. Basis description and overview of projection results

   * Traits that we used to create the basis (table 1: 40 cytokine/chemokines)
   * Out of all projections, only BMK and IMD classes are enriched (figure 1: pie chart), a mainly immune signal, suggesting specificity 
   * Majority of cytokine/chemokines can successfully replicate, suggesting reproducibility (figure 2: heatmap of Ahola/Folkersen/Hoglund/Sun projected to basis)
   * We will use only replicable cyokine/chemokines as reference in the following analysis


## 2. PC7 (figure 3. forest plot)

 * Supportative evidence from literature:
   * CXCL6 & T1D ;CXCL12 & T1D; CXCL1 & T1D; CXCL12 & Vitiligo; CXCL6 & Crohn's; CXCL1 & systematic lupus eryth ; CXCL12 & sarcoidosis
   
 * Novel:
   * CXCL6 & Celiac disease; CXCL6 & Vitiligo; CXCL6 & Autoimmune thyroid disease (potential protective) CCL8 & diseases

## 3. PC9 (figure 4. forest plot)

 * Supportative evidence from literature:
   * CCL21 & JRA (strong) RA (weak); CCL21 & T1D; CCL21 & coeliac disease; IL-16 & T1D
   * (Not sure if solid to discuss) CCL21 & JRA has a much strong signal than RA, indicates a more specific role of CCL21 in JRA? JRA has genetic sharing with RA,but also reported to be 
    each has unique genetic risk factors. CCL21 & RA were studied before, but not in JRA.
   
 * Novel:
   * IL-16 & coeliac disease; CCL21 & gout; CCL21 & hypothyroidism

## 4. PC10 (figure 5. forest plot)

 * Supportative evidence from literature:
   * CCL21 & T1D, & celiac disease ; CCL21 & vitiligo; CCL21 & autoimmune thyroid disease; CXCL6 & T1D; CXCL6 & psoriasis 
   
 * Novel:
   * CCL21 & psoriasis; CCL21 & Hypothyroidism; CXCL6 & Celiac disease; CXCL6 & Vitiligo; CXCL6 & Autoimmune thyroid disease


## 5. Summary
 * Specificity and reproductivity of this basis
 * In PC7,9,10, extensive evidence support the projection results, especially for those cytokines with extreme delta value. 
 * Projection gives interesting predictions.
 * While not mentioned above, other PCs are also worth digging into : such as PC15 (appendix figure)
