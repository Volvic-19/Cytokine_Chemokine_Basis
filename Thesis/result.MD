		1. CCL21: RA and JRA, something in common. JRA could last to adult. But JRA : more heterogenous, there is genetic risk different from adult-onset RA.
		Findings of previous in vivo studies suggest that CCL19 and CCL21 play an important role in a number of autoimmune diseases,
		such as multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, and RA.
		regulators of CCL19 and CCL21 in RA fibroblasts and in vitro–differentiated RA peripheral blood macrophages and demonstrate
		a novel role of CCL19/CCL21 in angiogenesis in RA.
		
		JRA and RA share some common and different genetic background. similar and difference in genetic risk factor
		(JRA, like RA, also has associations with HLA. However the different clinical subtypes of JRA themselves differ in their HLA associations.
		For instance, the class I gene HLA-B27 has consistently been found to contribute risk for pauciarticular JRA, especially among older males.
		HLA-DR1 and -DR4, class II genes, have been reported to increase the risk for polyarticular JRA. Much as in adults with RA, HLA-DR4 is
		associated with RF-positive polyarticular disease in older children. Interestingly, this gene might be protective in patients with EOPA.
		In this subtype, combined class I and II MHC associations are seen. Other MHC-encoded genes such as LMP7 have also been shown to be associated
		with early-onset JRA [33]. HLA-A2, HLA-DR5, HLA-DR8 and HLA-DPB1*0201 have all been shown to be associated with JRA by several investigators,
		and interactions between these alleles yield high odds ratios for EOPA [34–39]. It is possible that in this type of JRA, four individual genes
		(one HLA-A gene, two HLA-DR or DQ genes and an HLA-DP gene) may be involved [24]. Confirming the associations that have been reported, linkage
		between pauciarticular JRA and the HLA region has been shown both by using transmission disequilibrium testing in simplex families [40] and
		by allele sharing among affected sibling pairs [41]. Similarly, linkage between polyarticular JRA and the HLA region has also been shown by
		allele sharing among affected sibling pairs [41].)
		
		CCL21 & RA
		(The pathogenic importance of CCL21 and CCR7 in rheumatoid arthritis)
		(CCL21 is a risk factor for Rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
		CCL21 is highly elevated in RA synovial fluid and attracts circulating monocytes into the inflamed joint.
		CCL21 differentiates monocytes into a unique subtype of macrophages.
		Monokines produced from CCL21-differentiated macrophages promote Th17 cell polarization.
		CCL21-mediated Th17 cell development influences its ability to remodel osteoclasts and trigger angiogenesis.
		Joint CCL21 is directly implicated in RA angiogenesis.)
		
		CCL21 & RA: reported, but CCL21 & JRA, not yet in JRA
		our finding indicate a potentially more specific role in JRA.
		
		
		2. MSP : inhibit inflammatory cycle; while not covered by Ahola....
		(MSP exhibits anti-inflammatory properties on macrophage)
		(MSP markedly inhibited expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-18),
		chemokines (MIP-1, MCP-1 and RANTES) and iNOS, NO, COX-2 and PGE2 in RASF stimulated by LPS.)
		( In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of MSP on LPS-stimulated rheumatoid
		arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASF) and its underlying mechanism.)
		
		3. CCL21 & T1D : biomarker linked with pathogenesis for diabetic nephropathy;
		(Small EVs derived CCL21 mRNA increased significantly in DN patients and correlated with level of proteinuria and eGFR.
		Interestingly, elevated CCL21 mRNA from urine small EVs was observed in DN patients with normal renal function and could
		discriminate early DN patients from DM more efficiently compared to eGFR and proteinuria. )
		
		(Expression of CCL21 and 5′-Nase on Pancreatic Lymphatics in Nonobese Diabetic Mice)
		(These findings suggest that CCL21 and 5′-Nase may be involved in the interaction between infiltrating cells and lymphatic
		vessels to induce the functional changes of lymphatic endothelial cells during insulitic and diabetic development.)
		(As insulitis developed, the increased expression of CCL21 and podoplanin on pancreatic lymphatics was consistent with
		the increased number of cytoplasmic protrusions and vesicles, whereas 5′-Nase activity of lymphatics seemed to become decreased.
		The expression of CCL21 protein also showed an age-dependent increase in NOD pancreas, even though it was undetectable in normal controls.)
		
		4. CCL21 & coeliac disease: CCL21 expression in active coeliac patients, but not inactive / healthy
		(Chemokines are small proteins that promote leukocyte migration during development, infection, and inflammation.
		We and others isolated the unique chemokine CCL21, a potent chemo-attractant for naïve T-cells, naïve B-cells,
		and immature dendritic cells. CCL21 has a 37 amino acid carboxy terminal extension that is distinct from the rest
		of the chemokine family, which is thought to anchor it to venule endothelium where the amino terminus can interact
		with its cognate receptor, CCR7. We and others have reported that venule endothelium expressing CCL21 plays a
		crucial role in attracting naïve immune cells to sites of antigen presentation.)
		
		(Using a novel screening method, we identified a murine monoclonal antibody against the human endothelial chemokine CCL21 that blocked naïve and partially
		activated T-cell chemotaxis towards CCL21. This monoclonal antibody identified expression of CCL21 in active
		inflammatory diseases of the bowel. However, there was no expression in normal bowel, thus it may be a diagnostic marker for active IBD.)
		
		5. IL-16 & T1D
		(Neutralization of interleukin-16 protects nonobese diabetic mice from autoimmune type 1 diabetes by a CCL4-dependent mechanism)
		(In this study, we investigate the role of one of these mediators, interleukin-16 (IL-16), in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice.)
		(The increased expression of IL-16 in islets correlated with the development of invasive insulitis. IL-16 immunoreactivity was found in
		islet infiltrating T-cells, B-cells, NK-cells, and dendritic cells, and within an insulitic lesion, IL-16 was derived from
		infiltrating cells. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells as well as B220+ B-cells were identified as sources of secreted IL-16.
		Blockade of IL-16 in vivo protected against type 1 diabetes by interfering with recruitment of CD4+ T-cells to the pancreas,
		and this protection required the activity of the chemokine CCL4.)
		(We show that IL-16 potentiates insulitis and type 1 diabetes in NOD mice, and that anti-IL-16 antibody therapy protects against type 1
		diabetes even when administered at the mid-late stages of disease progression. )

		2. CCL21 & vitiligo:
		(The abundance of TGFB1 and CCL21 mRNA was significantly decreased in the peripheral blood of patients with aGV (active generalized vitiligo).
		Significant differences in forkhead box P3, transforming growth factor-β and CCL21 protein expression were found in skin sections.)
