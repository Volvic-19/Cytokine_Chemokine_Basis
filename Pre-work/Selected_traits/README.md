* Ferkingstad_basistraits_withduplicates.tsv : the current version of all cytokine/chemokine traits.

* Ferkingstad_duplicated_traits.tsv : the 10 duplicated traits that we need to compare using Manhattan plot.

* `Ferkingstad_duplicates` : contains Manhattan plots that side-to-side compare duplicated GWAS datasets of the same protein. Note that they are 'duplicated' because the same protein can be targeted by different aptamers. After comparison, we noticed no obvious evidence to exclude duplicates, so in the following part, we kept all 104 datasets as input to construct our basis.
